# Clock In App

This app is an idea I had so I play around with React.js more ... It's still very much in progress ...

## Testing locally
* Ensure node and npm are installed locally
* Run `git clone https://github.com/jiobiagba/clockin-frontend.git`
* `cd clockin-frontend`
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
